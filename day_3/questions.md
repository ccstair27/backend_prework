## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement is `==` or `<=` or `!=` or a lot of others.

2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

Because we may want some code to execute in one situation but some other code in another.

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```ruby
if condition
  puts "Then do this."
else
  puts "Otherwise, do this."
end
```

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

With `elsif` plus a futher condition.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

```ruby
if condition
  puts "Then do this."
elsif condition
  puts "Or do this."
else
  puts "Otherwise, do this."
end
```

6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

We could use it in a `while` loop so that it stops or keeps going depending on a condition.
